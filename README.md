# nppR

## Overview

The package nppR provides a collection of tools for making inference
based on non-probability sample data by integrating information
from auxiliary probability sample data.

## Installation

``` r
# First, install dependencies:
install.packages(pkgs = c("R6","survey","tibble"))

# Install nppR from source of a particular tag; for example, to install from tag v1.13.003:
install.packages(repos = NULL, type = "source", pkgs = "https://github.com/StatCan/nppR/raw/v1.13.003/nppR_1.13.003.tar.gz")

# Or the development version from GitHub:
install.packages(pkgs = c("devtools"))
devtools::install_github("StatCan/nppR")
```
